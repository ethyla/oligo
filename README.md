This project aims to show that token based governance is not a good idea.  
To do this it simplifies the buying and selling of votes.  


## Status

Still in development. MVP Frontend is done. Contracts are 80% there. So there is no testnet version.  
We tried buidler for the first time, but it didn't fully work out for us. That"s why there is buidler and truffle in there.
